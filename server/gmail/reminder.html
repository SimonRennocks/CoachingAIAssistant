<p>Hi {{name}}!</p>
<p>Thank you for scheduling your session with me. I am looking forward to our session on  - {{date}}, {{time}} {{zone}}
</p>
<p>If something comes up and the scheduled time will not work, <strong>let me know a minimum of 6 hours before the appointment
    time</strong> and we’ll figure something out.</p>
<p>This session will take place here: <strong>{{zoom}}</strong></p>
<p>
    <ul>
        <li>(If you have not used zoom before please join the meeting at least 15 minutes early because it may have you
            download and install some software.)</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>Again, all I need from you:
    <ul>
        <li>Be on <u>Tutors & Students Slack</u> 5 minutes before your time slot.</li>
        <li>Make sure your computer/mic/internet connection are working.</li>
        <li>Make sure your workspace is quiet and free from interruptions.</li>
        <li>At the end of the session, I will provide you with a link to a 2 minute evaluation form that you are
            required to complete.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>Slack or email me with any questions.  I’m looking forward to our meeting!</p>
