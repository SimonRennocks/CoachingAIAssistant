    <p>Hi Everyone!</p>
    <p>I hope you had a great week! I have attached a link below to schedule another tutoring session if you wish. If
        you are already scheduled, please ignore this email.</p>
    <h3><center>http://bit.ly/CalendySimonRennocks</center></h3>
    <p><strong>On the Calendly page, be sure you have the correct time zone selected in
        the section labeled "Times are in"</strong></p>
    <p>If our availability doesn’t sync, let me know and I'll see if we can figure something out.</p>
    <h4>Maximum tutorial sessions per week - our week is Monday - Sunday:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><i>Part-time (6 month boot camp) students are entitled to 1 session per week.</i></li>
        <li><i>Full-time (3 month boot camp) students are entitled to 2 sessions per week.</i></li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you have any questions or none of the times available work for you please let me know and I would be happy
        to help.</p>
    <p>If you would like to schedule regular, recurring sessions at the same day/time each week, just let me know by
        REPLY ALL and we can work it out.  This is particularly useful if you have a strict schedule so you won't have
        to compete for time on my calendar.</p>
    <h4>CC Central Support on all email by always using REPLY ALL.</h4>
    <p>Sincerely,<br />Simon</p>
